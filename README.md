## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Doing this challenge has helped me practice what I learned on my own. A little reminder about pseudo-classes did me a world of good too.
Practice helps me to think faster, to use my tools more effectively every time.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/) - It has become essential for me to have this page open so that I can have a reminder and all the options available to me in my choices.
